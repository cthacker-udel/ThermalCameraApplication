# ThermalCameraApplication

> This is an application who's primary target is photography users who use the thermal camera mostly. As a added side bonus, we also have a internal community of users who can utilize our app to post their pictures, or garner discussions about topics revolving around thermal cameras, or really anything in general!

## Process

- Sign Up
  - The user is required to sign up with an account to utilize our application, that requires just a username and password. If you want to enter more in, feel free! We have extra options such as the first name, last name, email, and phone number can optionally be entered in among sign-up. 
- Login
  - After the user has signed up, they can proceed to the login page, all the user has to do is enter in their password and username. Errors are displayed to the screen while the user is entering in their username!
- Home Page
  - Once the user has logged in, they are directed to the home page, this is an area where the most recent posts are streamed, and the stats of those posts are displayed as well. Such as the number of comments, the number of trophies, and the number of up-votes that post has.
- Individual Post Page
  - The user can click on a post they see displayed on the home page, to bring up an individualized page consisting of that post details, such as the user that posted it, the number of up-votes it garnered, the number of comments, and the number of trophies as well. Here, the user can leave a comment or react to the post to contribute to the discussion!
- Camera Page
  - This page requires that a thermal camera is detected and properly configured with your android device. If that is the case, the user is able to take either a front-facing picture or a selfie picture to either post, or even just save in their camera roll! This allows for quick integration and introduction into the internal community!
- User Settings Page
  - This page is self-explanatory, for all user settings the user wants to modify, they can do so on this page!
